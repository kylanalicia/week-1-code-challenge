# week-1-code-challenge
DESCRIPTION.
## Author: Kylan Alicia
The challenge involves creating three separate programs for calculating output based on user input.

STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR.
Inputs required for the program to run are as follows:
    A = 79 - 100
    B = 60 - 79
    C = 49 - 59
    D = 40 -49
    E = < 40
The student grade is calculated by adding up all of their scores.
If a score falls in between two grades, then round it down and assign that grade.

SPEED DETECTOR.
This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car and outputs "Ok" if the speed is less than 70, and for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

NET SALARY CALCULATOR.
This calculator calculates net salary by getting inputs of basic salary and benefits.
